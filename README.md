# Ayakana
Ayakana is my first 3D Platform game made with Unity.
You control a character who needs to collect crystals around the map. 
You can repeatedly jump to start to "fly" and get the crystals waiting on the clouds.


You can find in this repository, the script for the crystal you can collect in the game, and the script for the character.


You can download the game here:
